# DesignToCode
   A 15 days challenge I gave myself to improve my frontend development skills. Recently I took a course on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn frontend development. This way to convert design tocode is a great way to learn, hence my 15 days midnight challenge begins.
   
   **Day 1**
   Turned the design of [To-do App - Matt's Profile by Nicola Baldo](https://dribbble.com/shots/4544339-To-do-App-Matt-s-Profile) from dribble to live code.
