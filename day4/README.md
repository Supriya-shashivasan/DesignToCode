# DesignToCode
   A 15 days challenge I gave myself to improve my frontend development skills. Recently I took a course on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn frontend development. This way to convert design tocode is a great way to learn, hence my 15 days midnight challenge begins.
   
#### Day 4
   ##### Turned the design of [Product Page by Asmita Deshmukh](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/daily-ui-challenge-002-interface) from uplabs to live code.
