# DesignToCode
   A 15 days challenge I gave myself to improve my frontend development skills. Recently I took a course on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn frontend development. This way to convert design tocode is a great way to learn, hence my 15 days midnight challenge begins.
   
#### Day 5
   ##### Turned the design of [Fluent design drive by Kalesh](https://dribbble.com/shots/4121514-Fluent-design-drive) from dribbble to live code.
