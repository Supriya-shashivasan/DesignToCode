# DesignToCode
   A 15 days challenge I gave myself to improve my frontend development skills. Recently I took a course on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn frontend development. This way to convert design to code is a great way to learn, hence my 15 days midnight challenge begins. All the code of each day is updated.
